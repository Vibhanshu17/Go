Learning Go

#### 1. Simple CLI app
* Its a todo, lol
* got to learn about file read/write in go, file locks & taking cli inputs

```
Usage of ./cli_todo:
  -id int
        task id to mark complete/delete
  -option string
        option to perform on tasks
        Choose from: 'create', 'list-all', 'mark-complete', 'delete' (default "list-all")
  -task value
        task to create
```
